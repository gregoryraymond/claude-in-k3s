# Claude in K3s

### Sandboxed AI coding agents. No DevOps degree required.

*Ever wanted to sandbox Claude Code in containers but don't have 10 years of DevOps experience? Same. So we built a button for it.*

*Claude Code runs in an isolated container. Your machine stays clean. Your secrets stay safe.*

## The Problem

You want Claude Code to work on your projects. But giving an AI agent unrestricted access to your filesystem, your SSH keys, your `.env` files, and your entire `$PATH` feels... uncomfortable.

**The "proper" solution** involves Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm charts, Docker builds, kubeconfig files, and a week of YAML debugging.

**This solution** involves clicking a button.

## What This Does

Claude in K3s is a **native desktop app** that spins up a local Kubernetes cluster on your machine and runs Claude Code inside isolated containers — one per project. Each pod gets its own filesystem, its own network namespace, and exactly the permissions you give it.

You get the sandboxing. You skip the 47-page runbook.

## Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### One-Click Infrastructure
The app detects missing tools (K3s, Terraform, Helm, Docker) and installs them for you. Terraform provisions the cluster. Helm deploys the pods. You click buttons.

### Smart Project Detection
Point it at a directory. It finds your projects, detects the language (Node, Python, Rust, Go, .NET), picks the right base image, and builds Docker containers automatically.

### Live Pod Management
Watch pods come up in real time. Tail logs. Send prompts to Claude directly from the app. Delete pods when you're done. Everything in one window.

### Resource Controls
Set CPU and memory limits per pod. Claude gets what you give it — no runaway processes eating your machine.

### Custom Dockerfiles
Need a special setup? Drop a `Dockerfile` in `.claude/` or your project root. The app picks it up and builds from that instead.

### Cross-Platform
Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL2). The GUI is native on every platform — no Electron, no browser, no 400MB runtime.

## How It Works

![Architecture](docs/images/architecture.png)

**The stack, simplified:**

| Layer | Tool | What It Does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Cluster** | Terraform + K3s | Creates a lightweight Kubernetes cluster on your machine |
| **Images** | Docker | Builds container images with your project code baked in |
| **Deployment** | Helm | Deploys Claude Code pods with your API key and config |
| **Interaction** | kubectl | Streams logs, executes prompts, manages pod lifecycle |
| **You** | This app | Clicks buttons instead of writing YAML |

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the app

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/claude-in-k3s.git
cd claude-in-k3s

# Build (release mode for smaller, faster binary)
cargo build --release

# Run
./target/release/claude-in-k3s
```

> **Requires:** Rust 1.70+. On Linux you'll also need display server headers (`libxkbcommon-dev`, etc.).

### 2. Let the app handle the rest

On first launch, the **Setup Panel** checks for required tools:

```
  ✓  k3s       v1.31.4     Found
  ✗  terraform              Missing  ← Click "Install All"
  ✗  helm                   Missing  ← and go get coffee
  ✓  docker    v27.4.1     Found
```

The app downloads and installs whatever's missing. No `curl | bash` pipelines to memorize.

### 3. Configure

Head to **Settings** and enter:
- Your **Anthropic API key**
- A **projects directory** (where your code lives)
- Resource limits (optional — defaults to 2 CPU / 4Gi RAM per pod)

### 4. Launch

1. **Cluster tab** → Click **Init**, then **Apply**. Terraform creates your K3s cluster.
2. **Projects tab** → Select projects. Click **Launch**. Docker builds images. Helm deploys pods.
3. **Pods tab** → Watch them come up. Send prompts. Read logs. Ship code.

---

## Configuration

Settings persist in `~/.config/claude-in-k3s/config.toml`:

```toml
api_key = "sk-ant-..."
projects_dir = "/home/you/projects"
claude_mode = "daemon"          # "daemon" (persistent) or "headless" (run and exit)

git_user_name = "Claude Code Bot"
git_user_email = "claude-bot@localhost"

cpu_limit = "2"
memory_limit = "4Gi"

terraform_dir = "terraform"
helm_chart_dir = "helm/claude-code"
```

## Supported Languages

The app auto-detects your project's language and selects the right base image:

| Detected File | Language | Base Image |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| `package.json` | Node.js | `node:22-bookworm-slim` |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust | `rust:1.83-bookworm-slim` |
| `go.mod` | Go | `golang:1.23-bookworm` |
| `requirements.txt` | Python | `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` |
| `*.csproj` | .NET | `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0` |
| *(none)* | Base | `debian:bookworm-slim` |

Need something else? Add a `Dockerfile` to your project's `.claude/` directory or project root.

## Why K3s?

[K3s](https://k3s.io/) is a certified Kubernetes distribution that runs in ~512MB of RAM. It's a single binary. It starts in seconds. It gives you real container isolation without the overhead of a full Kubernetes cluster.

**Compared to alternatives:**

| Approach | Isolation | Setup Complexity | Resource Overhead |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Run Claude on bare metal | None | Trivial | None |
| Docker containers | Process-level | Moderate | Low |
| **K3s pods (this project)** | **Namespace + cgroup** | **One click** | **Low** |
| Full Kubernetes (EKS, GKE) | Full | High | High |

You get real Kubernetes-grade isolation. On your laptop. Without the cloud bill.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this production-ready?</strong></summary>

This is designed for local development sandboxing, not production deployment. It's great for safely letting Claude work on your projects without giving it the keys to your kingdom.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does Claude have internet access inside the pod?</strong></summary>

By default, pods have outbound internet access (needed for API calls). Network policies can be configured via the Helm chart if you need tighter restrictions.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I run multiple Claude instances at once?</strong></summary>

Yes. Each project gets its own pod. Select multiple projects in the Projects tab and launch them all at once.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens to my code?</strong></summary>

Your project code is copied into the Docker image at build time. Changes Claude makes stay inside the container. Nothing writes back to your host filesystem unless you explicitly extract it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why Rust?</strong></summary>

A native binary with no runtime dependencies. The release build is small, fast, and starts instantly. No "please install Node 18 and Python 3.11 and also somehow Java" prerequisites.
</details>
